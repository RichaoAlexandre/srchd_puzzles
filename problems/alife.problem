Propose a computer simulation for artificial life that present the following properties:
(i) has concepts of entropy and energy that relate to our understanding of entropy and energy and how they relate (in particular maximum entropy production principle, and the fact that dissipative structure self organize to maximize energy flowing through them).
(ii) rules are maximally simple.
(ii) allows open evolution and the emergence of systems that can be considered as artificial life (non predictable evolution and characteristic all the way to forms of intelligence).
